for some reason, fdkaac is not built for armhf and is required for bluez-alsa


enable sources in /etc/apt/sources.list
apt update
change to directory of choice
sudo apt source fdkaac or libfdk-aac-dev
cd into the folder 
sudo apt build-dep fdkaac
sudo debuild -b -uc -us

this will make a deb file to install
