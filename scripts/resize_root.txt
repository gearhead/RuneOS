Actually you can resize the disk while active in arch linux.

As root:

fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

Delete the second partition /dev/mmcblk0p2
d
2

Create a new primary partition and use default sizes prompted. This will then create a partiton that fills the disk
n
p
2
enter
enter

Save and exit fdisk:
w


Now reboot. Once rebooted:
resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

Your main / partition should be the full size of the disk now.

When done through gparted, these are run to shrink a partition:
e2fsck -f -y -v -C 0 /dev/sdd2
resize2fs -p /dev/sdd2 6144000K
